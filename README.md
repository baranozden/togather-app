* At the end of each iteration, some artefacts or final products will be published in this repo.
* Work products of each iteration can be found at related folders which are named as *v-iteration_number* (for example: *v1* for iteration 1)
* A Quality Assurance Team is responsible for reviewing and sharing feedback about each iteration's output.
* The QA Team findings will be shared in the repo and a table related to the last iterations findings could be found in the below section.
* After implementing the QA findings, work products will be published under the folders which are named as *IterationnumberRevised* (for example: *Iteration1Revised* for iteration 1 revisions)
